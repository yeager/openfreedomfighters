# Intro bootstrap evidence and implementation gates

The original intro is not yet activated by the native runtime. Normal startup
prepares the verified UI resources and clears the window; the optional
diagnostic world preview does not establish bootstrap order. The project-owned
three-second splash is a separate presentation requirement, not a cut-sequence
clock or a substitute for original completion events.

## Independently reviewed behavior

Private research of the supported Steam build, reviewed on 2026-09-06, establishes
the following bounded controller contract without publishing original code or
serialized asset payloads:

- The controller has ordered sequence and group references, another field whose
  role remains unresolved, a destination string, a serialized boolean and up to
  two optional references. Optional references default to zero.
- Destination storage accommodates at most 99 bytes plus a terminator. A native
  decoder must reject overlength input rather than depend on original assertions.
- A separate runtime flag selects a fixed destination. It is not the serialized
  boolean; the two must remain distinct.
- Initialization resolves the lists and starts at the first sequence item.
- A matching registered completion event increments the sequence index. If
  another item remains, the controller requests its start and issues group-state
  requests according to the selected index. Exact visibility semantics remain
  unproven.
- Exhaustion clears the scene stack and requests the configured destination,
  unless the separate fixed-destination runtime flag selects its other branch.
- Start and completion events have symbolic registrations. Numeric IDs from an
  original process are not portable event constants.

Input-driven skip producers exist, but their complete guards and policy are not
recovered. Natural completion and the first activation trigger remain unresolved.
The authored destination must not be replaced with an assumed direct main-menu
transition.

## Required before decoding and activation

1. Establish the exact tagged class wrapper, field encodings, string boundaries,
   optional-field lookahead and terminal/trailing-data rules. Preserve unknown
   values rather than assigning invented semantics.
2. Establish authored source-reference lookup and bounded sequence/group-list
   decoding. These references are not the already implemented runtime object-pool
   handles; passing them through that decoder is invalid.
3. Recover configuration precedence and scene-name-to-resource resolution. The
   constructor default alone does not prove which scene an actual launch selects.
4. Recover initial activation, natural completion, timing dependencies and skip
   behavior. No guessed duration may drive progression.
5. Integrate with one scene-session owner for stack changes and load results.
   There is currently no native scene stack or script/event host. The generic
   simulation event queue provides ordering, not original event meanings or a
   proven intro update phase.

Each decoder requires public malformed-input tests and private verification on
the owned installation. Public fixtures must be independently authored, not
copied controller payloads. Runtime acceptance additionally requires an actual
intro-to-menu transition; parser success does not satisfy it. Original Windows
capture is currently unavailable, so camera and final pixel fidelity remain
unverified even as static research and native implementation proceed.
